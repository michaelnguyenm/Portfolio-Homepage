      <p>
        The goal for this project was to provide a way for people to get the
        most recently translated video clips from Youtube for their favorite Japanese
        "Virtual Youtubers" with filtering, searching, and sharing features.
        Additionally, the clips are linked to their original sources if the
        translator provided that information in the description of their clip.
        This application was built on a daily basis for over 2 months
        and has had periodic updates until I began submitting pull requests to
        fix bugs and implement small features on a similar website,
        <a href="https://holodex.net/" 
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">Holodex</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Key details:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Built with React.js (EMCAScript 6+) and
          <a href="https://material-ui.com/" 
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">Material-UI</a> for the front-end.
          The interface is responsive across mobile and desktop devices and
          features a single-page app with infinite scrolling.
        </li>
        <li>
          The data relationship is many-to-many between the translated clips and
          sources and uses a separate junction table to map this relationship.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created a RESTful API with Express.js to access information from the
          Postgres database with caching using Redis. API calls on the front-end
          are made naively with few joins and have not been optimized.
        </li>
        <li>
          A script is used daily with a cronjob to populate the database with
          more videos using Sequelize and the Youtube API.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apache is used to handle the routing with reverse proxies for the app,
          API, and this portfolio website.
        </li>
        <li>
          The full-stack is deployed on Linode using Docker. The
          repositories can be seen on Docker Hub

      <h4>React.js(Typescript)/Docker</h4>
      <p>
        The goal for this app was to learn the basics of React.js with
        Typescript and provide a fun app that plays spoken lines and sounds from
        a Youtuber's videos. This app was successfully deployed to a few hundred
        users on the first day.
      </p>
      <p>Key details:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Built with React.js (Typescript) and
          <a href="https://material-ui.com/" 
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">Material-UI</a> for the front-end.
          The interface is responsive across mobile and desktop devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          A geolocation API is used to determine the user's locale and displays
          a list of sounds in English/Japanese/Korean. This setting can be
          configured and is saved to local storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Docker image can be configured with different environment
          variables at runtime such as a different API key for the geolocation
          API or different location for the audio files.
        </li>

      <h4>MEAN stack</h4>
      <p>
        The goal for this project was to provide a service for which people
        could easily find related music for their favorite shows in an automated
        way. Prior to making the app, I found that someone was manually finding
        all of this information and eventually stopped updating his website as
        it was too much work for the owner to do regularly. The project,
        although incomplete, demonstrates the use of asynchronous operations and
        pipes with Angular and took over the course of two weeks to learn and
        implement.
      </p>
      <p>Key details:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Built on top of a MEAN stack (Angular 2+/Typescript) and Bootstrap.

      <h4>Python 3</h4>
      <p>
        As a requirement for the J-Pop Viewer app, I needed to pull data from
        various sources on the internet in an automated manner. In some cases, I
        was able to find a regularly updated database with a readily available
        API, but in other cases, I was forced to scrape data using the library,
        Beautiful Soup. This project took approximately a week while learning
        tools I had never used before.
      </p>
      <p>Key details:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Scraped data from <a href="https://livechart.me" 
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">livechart.me</a> for
          TV info and parsed it using Beautiful Soup.

          Testing performed with UnitTest/Travis-CI and can be deployed with
