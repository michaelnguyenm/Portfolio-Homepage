            <li>
              Created an Android game based on a Professor Layton minigame over the course of ten weeks with a team of three.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed in Java with Android Studio and uses native Android features.
            </li>
            <li>
              Uses JSON to load in various puzzles from assets. Data such as settings and score is kept persistant across sessions through the use of Android's shared preferences.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented vibration and sounds as feedback for the user as well as music.

      <p>
        The goal for this project was to provide a way for people to get the
        most recent translationed video clips off of Youtube for their favorite
        "Virtual Youtubers" with filtering and sharing features. Additionally,
        the clips are linked to their original sources if the translator
        provided that information in the description of their clip. This
        application was actively built on a daily basis for over 2 months and
        has had periodic updates after that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key details:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Built with React.js (EMCAScript 6+) and
          <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material-UI</a> for the front-end.
          The interface is responsive across mobile and desktop devices and
          features a single-page app with infinite scrolling.
        </li>
        <li>
          The data relationship is many-to-many between the translated clips and
          sources and uses a separate junction table to map this relationship.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created a RESTful API with Express.js to access information from the
          Postgres database. There are several routes:
          <a href="https://api.michaelmnguyen.me/api/channels">channels</a>,
          <a href="https://api.michaelmnguyen.me/api/videos">videos</a>,
          <a href="https://api.michaelmnguyen.me/api/video-to-videos"
            >video-to-videos</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          A script is used daily with a cronjob to populate the database with
          more videos using Sequelize and the Youtube API.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apache is used to handle the routing with reverse proxies for the app,
          API, and this portfolio website.
        </li>
        <li>
          The entire full-stack is deployed on Linode using Docker Hub. The
          repositories can be seen

      <h4>Typescript/MEAN stack</h4>
      <p>
        The goal for this project was to provide a service for which people
        could easily find related music for their favorite shows in an automated
        way. Prior to making the app, I found that someone was manually finding
        all of this information and eventually stopped updating his website as
        it was too much work for the owner to do regularly. The project,
        although incomplete, demonstrates the use of asynchronous operations and
        pipes with Angular and took over the course of two weeks to learn and
        implement.

        Key details:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Built on top of a MEAN stack (Angular 4) and Bootstrap.</li>

      <h4>Python 3</h4>
      <p>
        As a requirement for the J-Pop Viewer app, I needed to pull data from
        various sources on the internet in an automated manner. In some cases, I
        was able to find a regularly updated database with a readily available
        API, but in other cases, I was forced to scrape data using the library,
        Beautiful Soup. This project took approximately a week while learning
        tools I had never used before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key details:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Scraped data from <a href="https://livechart.me">livechart.me</a> for
          TV info and parsed it using Beautiful Soup.

            >anidb's HTTP API</a
          >
          to retrieve airing dates and
          <a href="http://vgmdb.info/">vgmdb's API</a> for music info.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed using Python 3 and stores scraped and parsed data inside
          MongoDB.
