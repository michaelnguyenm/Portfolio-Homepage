          <ul>
            <li>
              Created an Android game based on a Professor Layton minigame over the course of ten weeks with a team of three.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed in Java with Android Studio and uses native Android features.
            </li>
            <li>
              Uses JSON to load in various puzzles from assets. Data such as settings and score is kept persistant across sessions through the use of Android's shared preferences.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented vibration and sounds as feedback for the user as well as music.

          <h3>J-Pop Viewer <small><a href="https://github.com/michaelnguyenm/seasonal-jpop-app">Github</a> | <a href="http://ec2-52-25-78-67.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com">Website</a></small></h3>
          <h4>Typescript/MEAN stack</h4>
          <p>
              The goal for this project was to provide a service for which people could easily find related music for their favorite shows in an automated way. Prior to making the app, I found that someone was manually finding all of this information and eventually stopped updating his website as it was too much work for the owner to do regularly. The project, although incomplete, demonstrates the use of asynchronous operations and pipes with Angular and took over the course of two weeks to learn and implement.

            Key details:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Built on top of a MEAN stack (Angular 4) and Bootstrap.</li>
            <li>Front-end displays release dates for albums and related links for a given television airing season.</li>
            <li>Created a RESTful API to access information from MongoDB.</li>

          <h3>J-Pop Data Scraper <small><a href="https://github.com/michaelnguyenm/seasonal_jpop_scraper">Github</a></small></h3>
          <h4>Python 3</h4>
          <p>
              As a requirement for the J-Pop Viewer app, I needed to pull data from various sources on the internet in an automated manner. In some cases, I was able to find a regularly updated database with a readily available API, but in other cases, I was forced to scrape data using the library, Beautiful Soup. This project took approximately a week while learning tools I had never used before.

          <p>
            Key details:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scraped data from <a href="https://livechart.me">livechart.me</a> for TV info and parsed it using Beautiful Soup.</li>
            <li>Used <a href="https://wiki.anidb.net/w/HTTP_API_Definition">anidb's HTTP API</a> to retrieve airing dates and <a href="http://vgmdb.info/">vgmdb's API</a> for music info.</li>
            <li>Developed using Python 3 and stores scraped and parsed data inside MongoDB.</li>
            <li>Testing performed with UnitTest/Travis-CI and can be deployed with Docker.</li>
