# Portfolio Homepage
Building a website to display my portfolio served with apache2 at https://michaelmnguyen.me

This website is built with the following:

1. HTML
2. CSS with [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)
3. JavaScript, using AngularJS 1.6.0 with ui-router and jquery

Code is based off of examples hosted on [Bootstrap's website](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples) as well as [Scotch.io's routing using ui-router tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/angular-routing-using-ui-router).

Future plans are to fully implement the projects page, possibly displaying information from a noSQL database such as mongodb.
