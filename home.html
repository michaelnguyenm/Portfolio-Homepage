        I'm a software engineer with experience building web applications with
        React.js and native Android applications. I also have prior experience
        building tools with Windows Presentation Foundation which interface over
        the network with Android applications for debugging. As my prior
        experiences have been at startup companies, I had often been given the
        liberty to choose the best tools for the job and learn how to use them
        in short periods of time to meet deadlines. I am hoping to bring this
        experience and flexibility to a larger company with larger
        customer-facing applications and eventually grow to become a mentor for
        other engineers.

      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Managed all technical aspects of Virtuality Project LLC, a talent
          agency that assists live streamers in producing anime-centric video
          content, merchandising, and building communities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built a progressive web application with React.js and Typescript which delivers scheduling information
          from Twitter, live streams that are in progress on Twitch and YouTube,
          and indexes old videos for easy lookup for the fans. The web
          application leverages server-side rendering with Next.js for fast
          loading times and is deployed using Docker.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed a landing page which features the talents under the agency.
          It uses incremental static regeneration with Next.js to produce
          webpages which display live stream embeds from Twitch and YouTube when
          talents are live, and integrates a webstore for merchandise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built a YouTube chatbot which spawns additional instances when the
          server's webhook receives a notification that a talent has started
          streaming. This solution is built around Node.js events in Typescript
          and is a simple moderation bot which prevents spam and is in the
          process of being expanded to allow chatrooms to interact with the
          talents while streaming.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created commands in Python for a Discord chat bot so that managers and
          talents can easily update the website, community chatrooms, and social
          media all at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Manage automation with the workflow platform,
          <a href="https://n8n.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">n8n</a>,
          while creating custom solutions in Javascript to track talent
          activities on Twitch and YouTube. This information is served in
          real-time to fans on social media, the website, our community
          chatrooms, and even notifies our chatbot of new streams for
          moderation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed a simple database schema for relating talent information, their social
          media, and video content which can be accessed through an API that is
          used by the PWA, website, and chatbots.

          Enhanced Hauoli's motion tracking application for Android with network
          discovery and automatic audio level control to ensure that the
          application easily connects to the host computer and that the quality
          of the tracking is maintained at all distances, removing potential
          barriers for the end user.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed and implemented the interface to allow other Android
          developers to easily access data from a background service which wraps
          Hauoli's SDK. The service was built as a way to easily distribute the
          SDK so that developers did not have to incorporate any C++ native code
          and complicated build scripts and just focus on using the motion
          tracking data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created tools from the ground up in Java Swing and Windows
          Presentation Foundation to allow the user to test and debug Hauoli's
          motion tracking technology with PC games. The tools communicate with
          Hauoli's motion tracking application on Android/iOS.

          and Hauoli's tracking data for a music player application that can be
          implemented into smart speaker systems. Gesture control was also used
          to control other IoT devices such as smart light bulbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed a Unity SDK for developers to use audio-based motion
          tracking data from Android and iOS devices, and created several tech
          demos which were presented at Consumer Electronics Show 2018 and
          several investor meetings.
