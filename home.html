        I'm a software engineer with experience building web applications and services using Javascript/Typescript, utilizing technologies such as React (Next.js), APIs with Express.js and Hono, and desktop applications with Electron. I've worked on a live streaming platform and have experience in managing and optimizing developer workflows and deployments for monorepos using Turborepo. My past work includes designing APIs and database schemas, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and managing infrastructure across Google Cloud Platform. Having worked in startup environments, I've excelled at choosing the best tools for the job and learned how to use them in short periods of times to meet deadlines with a high degree of independence.

        <li> Architected applications and databases for internationalization (English and Japanese), collaborating with native application developers to ensure seamless utilization of translations between the native application and webviews. I created a process for over-the-air updates for translations through the library, <a href="https://www.i18next.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">i18next</a>, and the API for translation management service, <a href="https://lokalise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lokalise</a>. </li>
        <li> Supported our operations team with the creation of a <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React-based</a> admin panel which could display user history for comments, purchases, and bans. The admin panel utilized <a href="https://trpc.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tRPC</a> for end-to-end typesafety in addition to the existing <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Express.js</a> API for the client application. </li>
        <li> Managed and optimized the monorepo by using <a href="https://turbo.build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Turborepo</a>, streamlining the development and build processes across multiple internal packages and services.

      <ul>
        <li> Managed all technical aspects of Virtuality Project LLC, a talent agency that assists live streamers in producing anime-centric video content, merchandising, and building communities. </li>
        <li> Built a progressive web application with React.js and Typescript which delivers scheduling information from Twitter, live streams that are in progress on Twitch and YouTube, and indexes old videos for easy lookup for the fans. The web application leverages server-side rendering with Next.js for fast loading times and is deployed using Docker. </li>
        <li> Designed a landing page which features the talents under the agency. It uses incremental static regeneration with Next.js to produce webpages which display live stream embeds from Twitch and YouTube when talents are live, and integrates a webstore for merchandise. </li>
        <li> Built a YouTube chatbot which spawns additional instances when the server's webhook receives a notification that a talent has started streaming. This solution is built around Node.js events in Typescript and is a simple moderation bot which prevents spam and is in the process of being expanded to allow chatrooms to interact with the talents while streaming. </li>
        <li> Created commands in Python for a Discord chat bot so that managers and talents can easily update the website, community chatrooms, and social media all at the same time. </li>
        <li> Manage automation with the workflow platform, n8n, while creating custom solutions in Javascript to track talent activities on Twitch and YouTube. This information is served in real-time to fans on social media, the website, our community chatrooms, and even notifies our chatbot of new streams for moderation. </li>
        <li> Designed a simple database schema for relating talent information, their social media, and video content which can be accessed through an API that is used by the PWA, website, and chatbots. </li>

      <ul>
        <li> Enhanced Hauoli's motion tracking application for Android with network discovery and automatic audio level control to ensure that the application easily connects to the host computer and that the quality of the tracking is maintained at all distances, removing potential barriers for the end user. </li>
        <li> Designed and implemented the interface to allow other Android developers to easily access data from a background service which wraps Hauoli's SDK. The service was built as a way to easily distribute the SDK so that developers did not have to incorporate any C++ native code and complicated build scripts and just focus on using the motion tracking data. </li>
        <li> Created tools from the ground up in Java Swing and Windows Presentation Foundation to allow the user to test and debug Hauoli's motion tracking technology with PC games. The tools communicate with Hauoli's motion tracking application on Android/iOS. </li>
        <li> Designed a gesture-based control scheme using the open source <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/madlab/proj/dollar/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">$1 Unistroke Recognizer</a> and Hauoli's tracking data for a music player application that can be implemented into smart speaker systems. Gesture control was also used to control other IoT devices such as smart light bulbs. </li>
