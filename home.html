        I am a software engineer with experience building native Android
        applications and services as well as desktop applications using Java
        Swing and Windows Presentation Foundation at a small startup comprised
        of four people. As such, I am often given the creative liberty to choose
        the best tools for the job and learn how to use them in short periods of
        time to meet deadlines. I am hoping to bring this experience and
        flexibility to a larger company with larger customer-facing applications
        and eventually grow to become a mentor for other engineers.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Enhanced Hauoli's motion tracking application for Android with network
          discovery and automatic audio level control to ensure that the
          application easily connects to the host computer and that the quality
          of the tracking is maintained at all distances, removing potential
          barriers for the end user.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed and implemented the interface to allow other Android
          developers to easily access data from a background service which wraps
          Hauoli's SDK. The service was built as a way to easily distribute the
          SDK so that developers did not have to incorporate any C++ native code
          and complicated build scripts and just focus on using the motion
          tracking data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created tools from the ground up in Java Swing and Windows
          Presentation Foundation to allow the user to test and debug Hauoli's
          motion tracking technology with PC games. The tools communicate with
          Hauoli's motion tracking application on Android/iOS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed a gesture-based control scheme using the open source
          <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/madlab/proj/dollar/index.html"
            >$1 Unistroke Recognizer</a
          >
          and Hauoli's tracking data for a music player application that can be
          implemented into smart speaker systems. Gesture control was also used
          to control other IoT devices such as smart light bulbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed a Unity SDK for developers to use audio-based motion
          tracking data from Android and iOS devices, and created several tech
          demos which were presented at Consumer Electronics Show 2018 and
          several investor meetings.
